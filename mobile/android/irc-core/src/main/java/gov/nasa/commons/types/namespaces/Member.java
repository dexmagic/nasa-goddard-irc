 *  A Member is an Object that has a fully-qualified (i.e., globally unique) name. 
 *  A Member can optionally be linked to another Object having a fully-qualified 
 *  name in such a manner that the fully-qualified name of that Object will become 
 *  the name qualifier of the Member, and any change in the fully-qualified name of 
 *  that Object will be reflected in the name qualifier of the Member.
